How to train agent.py

* Start the server with Number of players = 5, Client response time = 5000 and Display sleep time = 2000
* Run PokerGame.py, PokerGame_opponent.py, PokerGame_opponent2.py, PokerGame_opponent3.py and PokerGame_opponent4.py. The agents will automatically connect to the server and start playing.
* The data is automatically saved in /datasets.
* Redo until desired amount of data is collected...

If any bugs should occur just let the server run out the game and start a new training. The server is shitty so this will happend several times.
